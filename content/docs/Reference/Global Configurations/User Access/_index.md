# User/Group Authorization

Authorization is used to determine what functions, data, or other parts of an application the user or the group has the access to.

You can manage the `User` and `Group` access to Projects, Applications, Chart Groups, Environments, and Roles using the `User Access` feature.


**View Access Levels**

There are four different view access levels available for both `User` and `Group`, namely:

* ***View Only:*** User(s)/Group(s) can view only selected applications.
* ***Admin:*** User(s)/Group(s) can view trigger and edit selected applications.
* ***Manager:*** User(s)/Group(s) can view, trigger and edit selected applications, can also manage user access.
* ***Build and Deploy:*** User(s)/Group(s) can build and deploy applications on selected environments.


To control the access of `User` and `Group`,  
Go to the left main panel -> Select `Global Configurations` -> Select `User Access`
